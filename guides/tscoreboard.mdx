## Requirements

Ensure the following dependencies are installed and configured:

- **ESX Framework**: Required for core functionality.
- **ox_lib**: Required for shared scripting utilities.
- **Badger_Discord_API**: Required for Discord avatar integration.

### Badger_Discord_API Configuration

1. Download [Badger_Discord_API](https://github.com/JaredScar/Badger_Discord_API).
2. Add the following to the `fxmanifest.lua` of `Badger_Discord_API`:

```lua
lua54 'yes'
shared_scripts {
    '@ox_lib/init.lua'
}
```

3. Add this callback to the `server.lua` file in `Badger_Discord_API`:

```lua
lib.callback.register('getDiscordAvatar', function(source, identifier)
    local discordId = nil
    local imgURL = "https://cdn.discordapp.com/embed/avatars/1.png"

    if identifier then
        if string.match(identifier, "discord:") then
            discordId = string.gsub(identifier, "discord:", "")
        else
            discordId = identifier
        end
    elseif source then
        for _, id in ipairs(GetPlayerIdentifiers(source)) do
            if string.match(id, "discord:") then
                discordId = string.gsub(id, "discord:", "")
                break
            end
        end
    end

    if discordId then
        if not Caches.Avatars then Caches.Avatars = {} end
        if Caches.Avatars[discordId] then
            imgURL = Caches.Avatars[discordId]
        else
            local endpoint = ("users/%s"):format(discordId)
            local member = DiscordRequest("GET", endpoint, {})
            if member and member.code == 200 then
                local data = json.decode(member.data)
                if data and data.avatar then
                    imgURL = ("https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/%s/%s.%s"):format(
                        discordId,
                        data.avatar,
                        data.avatar:sub(1, 1) == "a" and "gif" or "png"
                    )
                end
            else
                print("[Badger_Discord_API] ERROR: Failed to fetch Discord avatar for ID " .. discordId .. ". Code: " .. (member.code or "unknown"))
            end
            Caches.Avatars[discordId] = imgURL
        end
    end

    return imgURL
end)
```
